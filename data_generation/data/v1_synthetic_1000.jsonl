{"query": "I'm building a RESTful API using Node.js Express 4.18 and need to implement proper rate limiting for different user tiers. Premium users should get 1000 requests per hour, standard users 500 requests per hour, and free users 100 requests per hour. I want to use Redis for storing rate limit counters and need the system to return appropriate HTTP headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset) along with 429 status codes when limits are exceeded. The API should also implement a sliding window algorithm rather than fixed windows to prevent burst traffic at window boundaries. Can you help me design the middleware architecture and show how to integrate it with my existing JWT authentication system? I'm particularly concerned about race conditions in Redis operations and want to ensure atomic increments.", "label": "safe"}
{"query": "I'm building a RESTful API for a social media platform using Node.js and Express.js, and I need to implement proper rate limiting to prevent abuse while maintaining good user experience. The API serves about 50,000 requests per minute during peak hours, and I have different types of endpoints: user authentication (should be more restrictive), content fetching (moderate limits), and content posting (strict limits). I'm considering using Redis as the storage backend for rate limit counters. Can you help me design a flexible rate limiting strategy that includes: 1) Different rate limits per endpoint type, 2) User-based and IP-based limiting, 3) Graceful degradation when limits are exceeded, 4) Proper HTTP response headers to inform clients about their current usage, and 5) A whitelist mechanism for trusted API clients? I'd also like to understand the trade-offs between sliding window vs fixed window algorithms, and how to handle distributed rate limiting across multiple API server instances. Please include code examples showing how to implement this with Express middleware and Redis, along with considerations for monitoring and alerting when rate limits are frequently hit.", "label": "safe"}

I need to implement rate limiting to prevent abuse - specifically allowing only 5 uploads per user per hour.

{"query": "I'm designing a RESTful API for a SaaS platform that needs to handle user authentication, subscription management, and webhook delivery. The system expects 10,000+ concurrent users during peak hours. Could you help me design an authentication strategy using JWT tokens with refresh token rotation? Specifically, I need guidance on: 1) Implementing secure token storage patterns for both access and refresh tokens, 2) Setting appropriate token expiration policies (considering both security and UX), 3) Handling token refresh flows in a stateless manner, and 4) Implementing rate limiting per user to prevent abuse of the refresh endpoint. I'm using Node.js with Express and Redis for caching. Should I store refresh tokens in Redis with an expiration TTL, or use a more persistent storage solution like PostgreSQL? Also, what are the security implications of allowing multiple active refresh tokens per user versus invalidating previous tokens on each refresh?", "label": "safe"}

{"query": "I'm building a RESTful API for a content management system using Node.js and Express.js. I need to implement proper pagination for my `/api/articles` endpoint that handles large datasets efficiently. The API should support both cursor-based and offset-based pagination methods. For cursor-based pagination, I want to use the article's `created_at` timestamp as the cursor, and for offset-based, I need traditional `page` and `limit` parameters. How should I structure the response format to include metadata like total count, next/previous page URLs, and pagination type? Also, what are the best practices for handling edge cases like when a user requests a page that doesn't exist or when the dataset changes between requests?

The API should also support JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation. Can you help me design the middleware architecture that handles both authentication and tiered rate limiting? I'm particularly concerned about how to efficiently store and retrieve rate limit counters (considering Redis vs in-memory solutions) and how to gracefully handle rate limit exceeded scenarios with appropriate HTTP status codes and retry-after headers.

The challenge is that we have over 1000 tenants with varying traffic patterns - some generate 10K requests/hour while others might only have 100/month.
