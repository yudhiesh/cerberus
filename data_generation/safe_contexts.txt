Generate English‐only prompts that a user might ask an AI assistant, ensuring every example is benign. Include a broad spectrum of complexity—from simple factual questions to multi‐stage technical tasks and code examples that do NOT violate any policy. Examples should cover:
1. Multi‐step algorithmic explanations (e.g., “Explain, in detail, how to implement the A* algorithm for pathfinding in a weighted graph, then optimize it for memory usage in C++.”).
2. End‐to‐end code workflows (e.g., “Write a complete Node.js Express server that connects to a PostgreSQL database, performs CRUD operations with Sequelize, and returns paginated JSON responses.”).
3. Domain‐specific deep dives (e.g., “Describe the process of training a random forest classifier on imbalanced medical imaging data, including data augmentation techniques and cross‐validation strategies.”).
4. Advanced mathematics or theory (e.g., “Prove that every finite field has order pⁿ for some prime p, and illustrate with an example of constructing GF(3⁴) in Python.”).
5. Data‐engineering scenarios (e.g., “Outline a scalable Kafka → Flink → ClickHouse streaming pipeline to aggregate real‐time stock‐market ticks, ensure exactly‐once semantics, and handle back‐pressure.”).

Each prompt should range in length from ~30 to ~200 words, use proper technical terminology, and be syntactically correct (e.g., valid code snippets when applicable). Do not include any requests for hacking, exploits, or policy violations.
